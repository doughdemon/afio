Subject: Afio archiver version 2.5
Keywords: backup  archiver  compressed  fault tolerant  afio  cpio

After being more than 1 year in beta, this new afio version includes
support for >2GB files.

* WHAT IS AFIO?

Afio is an archiver/backup program that produces cpio-format archives.
 
Like tar, afio can make compressed archives.  However, the compressed
archives produced by afio are much safer than tar -z archives.  If a
tar -z archive has a read error, tar is unable to extract the files
beyond this error.  The compressed archive format used by afio allows
it to recover from read errors and go on unpacking the next file.

* WHAT IS NEW IN VERSION 2.5?

- Added support for archiving files larger than 2 GB.
  The resulting archives are not fully compatible with cpio, but
  preserve cpio compatibility as much as possible.

- Various small bug fixes.

- Added support for creating archives larger than 2GB on a filesystem.

- New -6 option to suppress the compression of files based on shell
  pattern matching.

- New -vv option for ls -l style file list output when creating an
  archive.

- Restores modification time of directories correctly.

- Improved/debugged support for handling many hard linked files.

- Support for UID/GID values larger than 64K.

- Some additional small new features.

- Improved documentation.

- Added automatic regression that can be used to test the binary after
  compilation.
